                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Brains before beauty: Warthogs may not be the most beautiful or graceful 
        creatures in the Animal Kingdom. But they are remarkable for their strength, 
        intelligence, and flexibility! Unlike many of their African counterparts, they are not
         endangered. This is because they are so skilled at adapting to new threats. For example,
          most warthogs like to forage during the light of the morning and early evening. But if they 
          live in an area where people hunt them, they switch to 
        foraging at night. It's not easy to catch them. </p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the warthog near the insect house.</p>
