                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
        also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians
         are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the
          broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms 
          monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families
           of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; 
        Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes). </p>
