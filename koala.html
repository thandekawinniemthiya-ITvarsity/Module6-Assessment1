                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p> The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing
         animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring. Though
          koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. They have two 
          opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws
           to grab onto branches. They have two toes, fused 
        together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
