                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p> Lions are the only cats that live in groups, which are called prides. Prides are family
         units that may include up to three males,
         a dozen or so females, and their young. All of a pride's lionesses are related, and 
         female cubs typically stay with the group as they age. Young males eventually leave and 
         establish their own prides by taking over a group headed by another male.</p>
  
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the lions in the Nouthern Frontiers.</p>
