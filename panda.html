                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>The Panda bear is a large mammal native to central China. These bears are also known 
        as giant pandas, or simply pandas. Though they famously dine on bamboo, pandas are bears, 
        and scientists still classify them as carnivores. While they will occasionally feed on eggs,
         rodents, or birds,
         over 99% of this bearâ€™s diet comes from bamboo plants.  </p>
     <p>Pandas are probably the most easily recognized bear in the world. Their fur is 
         starkly contrasting patches of black and white, with black ears and black eye patches. 
         Their legs, shoulders, and tail are also black, and the rest of their body is white.

        Pandas, like most bears, have short tails, measuring between 4 and 6 inches long. They 
        are moderately large bears, and males can weigh up to 350 lbs. or more. However,
         most pandas average between 220 and 254 pounds or so. </p>
   
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the panda in the Panda Canyon.</p>
